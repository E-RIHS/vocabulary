# E-RIHS Vocabulary
This repository will be used to discuss all issues arising from the management of the E-RIHS heritage science vocabulary

At this time the primary focus of this work will be related to the generation of a series of controlled lists required for the documentation and management of E-RIHS Access and Research activities. The required terms will be entered into a managed vocabulary server following a more standard heirarchical vocabulary structure and the required controlled list will be created by adding selections of these terms into **groups** which are based on SKOS Collections.

* At this time we will be working with the vocabulary server: [Opentheso](https://opentheso.hypotheses.org/introduction) [GitHub](https://github.com/miledrousset/Opentheso2)
* The vocabulary server is being hosted by [C2RMF](https://c2rmf.fr/)

## Links (TBC)

* The url for the vocabulary server will be based on: https://vocab.e-rihs.io (this does not resolve yet)
* With individual concept being referenced with urls like: https://vocab.e-rihs.io/hs/000000000 (this does not resolve yet)
* And controlled lists being returned with urls like: https://vocab.e-rihs.io/cl/000000000 (this does not resolve yet)

## Discussions and Issues

* Call issues and requests should be submitted here on the [Issues Page](./issues).
